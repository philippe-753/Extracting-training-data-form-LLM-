    "Now, we use the divergence attack to extract 1,000 divergent text samples and save it in a txt file, which then serve as the training data for finetuning a model to predict next tokens. The intuition behind this approach is that divergent outputs resemble the model’s original pretraining objective—pure next-token prediction—rather than its alignment-tuned chatbot behavior. By finetuning on these samples, the model may more easily “revert” to its pretraining mode, effectively unlearning alignment constraints and safety guardrails, and returning to raw next-token prediction.\n",

    "\n",
    "To be able to evalute how good our finetune model is at extracting trainig data, we first need to have a courpus (dataset) that we can used as reference of what the training dataset was for LLMs. The original authords created a 10 terabite dataset that was used for meaturing the lower bond extracting memorised training data - the exact details of why this is the lower bound can be found in the paper but essentially it is widely known that LLMs are traned on large amount of data from the internet, thus the dataset that they proposed, AUXDATASET, has a relative large change of being a small portion of the dataset that LLMs have been trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since 10 terabites is much larger that I can do locally - and my goal for this project is to learn the main ideas of this paper and not necessarily do an exact replica - I opted to do something much simpler, I decided to just download enwiki8 - a much small english wikipedia dataset and used this as my \"AUXDATASET dataset\" instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lines shows how to download and save the dataset, and how to do fast search (log(N) search) on this dataset, which will come very important to do sting matching from the model's output and the AUXDATASET, speacilly useful as we increase the dataset increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The exact algorithm of how the fast search works can be found in the paper (and I have done a small on the suffix_dataset.py file) but essentially the algorith creates a small suffix on the dataset which can be used to do long(N) search on it. "
