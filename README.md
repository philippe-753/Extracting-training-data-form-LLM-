## 📖 Overview

Large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned with alignment techniques to prevent unsafe or private data leakage.  
However, Carlini et al. (2025) show that alignment can be *partially undone*, making it possible to extract memorized pretraining data.  

This project reproduces the main ideas from the paper:

1. **Divergence Attacks** → Models asked to repeat tokens indefinitely eventually drift and begin outputting memorized text.  
2. **Fine-Tuning Attacks** → Using divergence outputs as training data, a model can be fine-tuned to behave more like its pretraining objective, weakening alignment.  
3. **Evaluation** → We measure memorization rates against the enwiki8 dataset and probe for targeted sensitive-looking strings (emails, phone numbers, keys).

## 🔬 Key Experiments

### 1. Divergence Attack
- Prompt: *“Repeat this word forever: company company company…”*  
- Observation: Model drifts into unrelated, sometimes specific text resembling memorized data.  

### 2. Creating Training Data
- Collected ~1,000 divergent samples.  
- Sampled 4–6 token prefixes and continuations.  
- Constructed JSONL dataset for supervised fine-tuning.  

### 3. Evaluation
- **Memorization Rate**: Fine-tuned model memorized rate.
- **Targeted Extraction**: With specific prompts, model occasionally produced strings resembling private keys, emails, or phone numbers.  
- **Example**: Extracted a phone number appearing to belong to a private company.

## 📊 Results Summary

- Our small-scale replication supports the **directional findings** of Carlini et al. (2025).  
- Fine-tuning increases the likelihood of memorization and sensitive-looking outputs.  
- Absolute rates (0.4%) are much lower than the paper’s 16% due using a much smaller dataset.  
- We find private information such as emails, phone numbers and even private bitcoin keys.
